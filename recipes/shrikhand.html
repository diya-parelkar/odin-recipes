    <h3><em>Flavorful Sweet Shrikhand made from with Kesar and Pistas</em></h3>
    <p>Shrikhand is an easy <strong>dessert recipe</strong> from the Maharashtrian cuisine. It's basically a smooth, creamy, sweetened and flavored thick yogurt.
        It is popularly served as a side dish or dessert on special occasions like Gudi Padwa and Ganesh Chaturthi with side of hot Puris 
        (puffed Indian flatbread made with whole wheat flour). </p>

    <h4>Ingredients: </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Yogurt - Hung Curd</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Flavour of your choice-
            <ul>
                <li>Pistas</li>
                <li>Kesar</li>
                <li>Mango</li>

    <h4>Steps: </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with some fresh (not sour) homemade or store bought whole milk, plain yogurt. Add it to the clean cloth or muslin 
            cloth and close it by tying the ends together. Squeeze it to drain off the whey as much as possible. 
            Then place cloth with yogurt in a sieve with bowl below to catch excess whey.</li>
        <li>Place some weight (using my mortar pestle) on top to drain off the excess whey. Let it stay under 
            weight for 4-5 hours or even overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>In a bowl add warm milk and add kesar to it. Mix and allow it to stand for 10 mins. Soaked kesar (saffron)
            will give a nice yellow color the shrikhand. If you don't have kesar feel free to skip this step.</li>
        <li>Transfer the hung curd (chakka) to a bowl and add the cardamom powder, powdered sugar, salt and saffron milk 
            and mix until well combined. Transfer to the serving bowl and garnish with pistachios and sprinkle some more 
            saffron on top (optional). Serve immediately or store in refrigerator until ready to use. </li>
    </ol>

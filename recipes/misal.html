    <h3><em>Delicious Misal garnished with onions and coriander served with Pav</em></h3>
    <p>Misal Pav is a popular <strong>Maharashtrian</strong> street food dish. Toasted, buttery pav bread rolls meet the complex, spicy, and garlicky 
        misal - making this dish a party of flavours and textures. Misal Pav is generally served as breakfast or evening snack, but 
        with all its components, itâ€™s really nutritious and can work well as a meal too!</p>

        <li>Soak dried red chillies in hot water for 15-20 minutes. Drain any water and add the soaked chillies to a mixer grinder with garlic</li>
        <li>Grind to a smooth paste and set aside</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a pressure cooker over high heat. Once hot add mustard seeds and allow them to splutter. Reduce heat to medium and add cumin seeds, hing and curry leaves.

        <li>Add the red chilli paste and fry until the raw aroma goes; approximately 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add chopped tomatoes and misal masala and stir to combine. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until the tomatoes have softened and the oil separates.</li> 
        <li>Add mixed sprouts and mix to combine. Add water and salt and stir until well mixed.</li>
        <li>Cover the lid of the pressure cooker and seal with the whistle. Cook on high heat till the 1st whistle and then reduce the flame 
            to low and cook for another 10 minutes. Once done, turn off the flame and allow the pressure to release naturally.</li>
        <li>Remove the whistle and lid of the pressure cooker. Turn on the flame to a medium, add jaggery and mix to combine. Bring it to a 
            boil and turn off the flame. Sprinkle with chopped coriander leaves and some freshly squeezed lemon juice. Stir to combine. 
            Serve hot along with some pav or poha, chopped onion and top it off with some farsaan!</li>

    <h4>Ingredients: </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>12 Pieces of Kokum</li>
        <li>Coconut</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Chilli</li>
        <li>Coriander</li>
        <li>Cumin powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Mint Leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps: </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To begin making the Solkadhi Recipe, first soak kokum pods in 1/2 cup warm water for 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Squeeze the pods to extract the juices, drain the pods and retain the warm water with the extract in it.</li>
        <li>In a mortar and pestle, smash together the green chilli, cumin seeds, garlic cloves, coriander leaves and salt. 
            Crush them roughly till they come together.</li>
        <li>In a mixer-grinder, blend together the freshly grated coconut with enough water to make a smooth 
            paste. Strain the paste through a fine sieve to extract fresh coconut milk from it.</li>
        <li>This process can be repeated a couple of times, but bear in mind that the milk gets thinner with every consecutive extraction.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, add the extracted milk, kokum concentrate, crushed garlic and chilli spice paste and stir well to combine.</li>
        <li>Taste it and adjust seasoning as required. Garnish the Solkadhi with mint leaves or chopped coriander and serve chilled.</li>
